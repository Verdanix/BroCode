**Contributing to BroCode**

Welcome to BroCode, the official repository for bro code rules! We're excited to have you contribute to this project and be a real one.

**Understanding Articles, Sections, and Clauses**

* **Articles**: These are the main categories or domains of the bro code. Think of them as chapters in a book or specific areas of a bro's life.
* **Sections**: These are subcategories within an article. They provide more specific guidance on a particular aspect of bro culture.
* **Clauses**: These are the individual rules or regulations that make up a section.

**Contributing to BroCode**

To be a bro and contribute, simply follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**: Click the "Fork" button to create your own copy of the BroCode repository.
2. **Create a new article, section, or clause**: Add a new branch to your forked repository and create a new article, section, or clause according to our guidelines.
3. **Submit a pull request (PR)**: Once you've created your new article, section, or clause, and optionally edited the contribution index (for first-time contributors), submit a PR to merge it into the main BroCode repository.
4. **Get approval from at least 5 "bro"s**: To ensure that the change is valid and aligns with our vision of bro culture, we require that at least 5 "bro"s approve of the PR.

**PR Guidelines**

When submitting a PR:

* Clearly state what changes you're making to BroCode
* Provide context for why these changes are necessary
* Engage with other contributors in the comments section of your PR

**Contribution Book**

As we collect contributions from around the world, we plan to compile them into a beautiful book. At the back of each book will be an index listing every contributor's:

* **GitHub username**: So you can see who else is contributing to BroCode
* **Social media handle**: So we can give you proper bro cred. Be a bro and don't provide NSFW socials.

**Join us!**

We're excited to have you join our community and contribute to BroCode. Let's build the most comprehensive bro-code rulebook out there!
