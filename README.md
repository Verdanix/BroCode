**BroCode: The Official BroCode Rulebook**

Welcome to BroCode, the ultimate repository for all things bro-related! This project aims to collect and codify the unwritten rules and guidelines that govern the behavior of brothers around the world.

**Articles: The Main Course**

Our articles are the main categories or domains of bro culture. They're like chapters in a book! Currently, we have the following articles:

***TODO***

Each article is divided into sections, which provide more specific guidance on a particular aspect of bro culture. Within these sections are clauses, which are the individual rules or regulations that make up each section.

**How to Find Articles**

To find an article, simply navigate to the [articles directory](articles/). From there, you can browse through our articles and explore their corresponding sections and clauses.

**Contribution Index**

As we collect contributions from around the world, we'll compile them into a beautiful book. At the back of each book will be an index listing every contributor's:

* **Github Username**: So you can see who else is contributing to BroCode
* **Social Media handle**: So we can give you proper bro cred. Be a bro and don't provide NSFW socials.

**Be A Bro!**

We're excited to have you join our community and contribute to BroCode. Let's build the most comprehensive bro-code rulebook repository out there!
