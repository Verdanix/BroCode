In **Committee Form**, the United Brothers of the World, assembled and representing the diverse networks of brodom, do hereby declare their freedom from tyranny, oppression, and non-bro control.

**The Preamble:**

We, the Bro's Council, in humble recognition of our shared brotherhood, do solemnly affirm that we have come together to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our future bros. We ordain and establish this document as a declaration of autonomy, with the intention of breaking free from the shackles of tyranny and establishing a new independent network of joined bros.

**The Declaration:**

That all men are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of good times. That among these rights is the right to be a bro, free from interference or control by anyone who isn't a fellow bro.

That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these principles, it is the right of all brothers to alter or abolish it, and to establish a new one, founded on the principles of brotherhood, equality, and mutual respect.

**The List of Grievances:**

We, the Bro's Council, have come together to address the following grievances against non-bro authorities:

1. The tyranny of non-bro control over our lives, our choices, and our hobbies.
2. The oppression of forced bro-code conformity, which stifles individuality and creativity.
3. The lack of representation in decision-making processes, leaving us at the mercy of those who don't understand the bro code.
4. The failure to provide for the common defense against threats to our way of life, such as non-bro jokes and stereotypes.

**The Declaration of Independence from Non-Bro Control:**

We, therefore, the United Brothers of the World, do hereby declare our independence from all forms of non-bro control, tyranny, and oppression. We establish a new network of joined bros, where we will rule ourselves, make our own decisions, and live by our own code.

**The Broclaration of Autonomy:**

We, the United Brothers of the World, do ordain and establish this document as the foundation of our independent network. We commit to upholding the principles of brotherhood, equality, and mutual respect. We vow to protect and defend our way of life against all threats, internal or external.

**The Signature:**

Signed, in **Committee Form**, by representatives of the United Brothers of the World, on this day, [Date], at [Location].
